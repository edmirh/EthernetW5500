<h3>Ethernet W5500</h3>
<p>The W5500 chip is hardwired TCP/IP embedded Ethernet controller that provides easier Internet connection to embedded systems. W5500 enables user to have the Internet connectivity in their applications just by using single chip in which TCP/IP stack, 10/100 ethernet MAC and PHY embedded. This chip supports TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, ARP, IGMP and PPPoe protocols. W5500 embeds the 32Kbyte internal memory buffer for the Ethernet packet processing.</p>

<h3>How to use?</h3>
<p>First connect your microcontroller with Ethernet W5500 device, for this communication I used SPI Master/Slave communication protocol. Follow this wired diagram:</p>
